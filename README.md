### Available Commands

```bash
# STEP 1: Install Deps
npm install

# STEP 2: Run Backend Project
npm run start:dev

# STEP 3: Run CLI
npm run tz-cli
```

### Recommendation

To run the project successfully.

- First start the backend project and then run the CLI.
- Since this is test project, I've attached '.env.example' file and reccommend you to rename the file to '.env'
